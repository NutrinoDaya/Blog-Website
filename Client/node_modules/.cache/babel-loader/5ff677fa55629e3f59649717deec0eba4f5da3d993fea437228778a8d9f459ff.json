The writer is also supposed to discuss leaf anatomy and biochemical pathways about each type of plant. This example lab science essay describes how light is absorbed by the attenna pigments of Photosystems I and II, explains what happens when carbon dioxide interacts with the stomata of a plant and how a C4 plant anatomy is called a Kranz anatomy. This essay also includes a breakdown of points and the prompt. From angelfire.com. 690 words / 2 pages The effects of chlorine exposure - Sample chemistry essay This sample chemistry research paper delves into the widespread use of chlorine and what can happen when the human body is exposed to it. It cites several scientific studies, notes how chlorine exposure has been reduced in the workplace and the use of the methyl orange procedure to test for chlorine. The paper also suggests that the positives that chlorine brings may outweigh its negative side-effects. While it could potentially be better organized, this sample laboratory science paper would be a good reference for a student who wants to analyze a well-known chemical substance in detail. From oxbridgewriters.com. 1,716 words / 5 pages Searching for gravitational waves - Sample physics research paper This example physics research paper discusses the search for gravitational waves, which were first discussed in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. While gravity waves have not yet been discovered, this sample physics term paper explains the various methods in which scientists have been trying to find them. The sample science paper discusses the use of resonant mass detectors and interferometry. In general, this paper is very good, though it can be improved in a few areas. It could use a better description of gravity waves in the introduction and could have a better conclusion. Finally, this sample lab science paper needs to cite more print, peer reviewed articles.
